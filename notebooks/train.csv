2024-09-24 22:52:57,429 - INFO - Stores with missing CompetitionDistance: [291, 622, 879]
2024-09-24 22:52:57,429 - INFO - Stores that later have valid CompetitionDistance: []
2024-09-24 22:52:57,429 - INFO - Findings summary: The analysis revealed that three stores—Store 291, Store 622, and Store 879—have missing values in the CompetitionDistance column. Further examination confirmed that none of these stores later acquired a valid CompetitionDistance, indicating a consistent lack of data for this feature throughout the dataset. This absence could impact any analyses or predictive modeling efforts utilizing CompetitionDistance, as it limits the understanding of competitive dynamics for these specific locations. To address this issue, it is recommended to consider alternative approaches, such as imputing values based on nearby stores, excluding these stores from analyses where CompetitionDistance is essential, or exploring other features that may provide insights into store performance without relying on this metric.
